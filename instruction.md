# This file is use for brainstorm idea
AS you can know when we are using the visual studio code or github, we often search code to see which file and which line have the same code. But it just use on the single repository and only in vscode, that is not inconvinience, and also it not support export the search result, and not support open multi file. So I have an idea that I want a terminal tool using nodejs and can interact with search file on the folder or workspace we choose, after search, it also support export search result as txt file or markdown file. Also, if great, it can have option to open file have keyword search in default code editor
